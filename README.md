This will create a properly formatted README file on GitHub, where the code snippets are clearly separated in code blocks and the repository instructions are easy to follow.

### Instructions to Create:
1. Create a `README.md` file in the root of your Git repository.
2. Copy the markdown above into the `README.md` file.
3. Add, commit, and push the changes to GitHub:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add instructions to README"
git push origin main
```
## ‚Ä¶or create a new repository on the command line
```bash
echo "# waifuneverdie" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/waifuneverdie/waifuneverdie.git
git push -u origin main
```
## ‚Ä¶or push an existing repository from the command line
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/waifuneverdie/waifuneverdie.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
